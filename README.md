# TDDFT-output-and-scripts

**Description:** Output files, figures, and visualization scripts used for computational nanoscience research with Varga group.
See below for information on each folder.

        **_FIGURES:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:

        **ELI_pulse_data_and_scale:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:

        **excel_laser_generation:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:

        **histograms_stats_molecule_formation:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:

        **pulse_electron_graph:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:

        **pulse_vector_animation:** The program expects 4 different inputs. The former two must be in the form of input files. The latter two can be given as command line arguments or runtime input after running the program with no arguments:
